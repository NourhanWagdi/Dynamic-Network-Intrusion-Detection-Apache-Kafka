# Dynamic Network Intrusion Detection
This solution consists of 2 phases of Network intrusion detection:
1) Static detection using Decision trees and SVMs.
2) Dynamic detection using flows of network traffic through an Apache Kafka server using an implementation of the sliding window protocol for a number of iterations.
